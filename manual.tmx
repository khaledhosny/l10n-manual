        <seg>Computers are amazing tools. They can help us in so many ways, yet we are often frustrated when they don’t work the way we want them to. We are frequently in interaction with technology where we change the way they work, and they change the way we work. A lot of this change is good, but we are not always aware how it changes us.</seg>

        <seg>A lot of technologies we work with often, such as software, web sites and cell phones, contain text which is in some language or another. Today, it is often in one of the major languages of the world, such as English or French. Those of us who understand the language of the technology are able to use it, while other people might be entirely locked out, or unable to fully enjoy the benefits that the technology brings.</seg>

        <seg>This book explains how software can be <bpt i="0" x="0">&lt;f0&gt;</bpt>localised<ept i="0">&lt;/f0&gt;</ept><bpt i="1" x="1">&lt;f1&gt;</bpt> – the process whereby software is translated or adapted in some other way. It will empower the user with knowledge of the issues and tools involved in translating software into new languages to ensure that technology is usable for more people, and to ensure that more languages become used in information technology.<ept i="1">&lt;/f1&gt;</ept></seg>

        <seg>It is important to realise that even if we are able to use technology in our second or third language, the constant exposure to this language doesn’t only allow us to use the technology, but it also slowly degrades our ability to use our own language. It is my belief that languages that are not used in all the important spheres of our lives will have a hard time surviving the onslaught of globalisation. Software localisation can therefore not only help with access to information and useful technology, but also with language revival and cultural preservation.</seg>

        <seg>This book specifically discusses the localisation of so-called <bpt i="0" x="0">&lt;f0&gt;</bpt>Free and Open Source Software<ept i="0">&lt;/f0&gt;</ept><bpt i="1" x="1">&lt;f1&gt;</bpt> (FOSS) – software that we are able to localise and distribute freely. Many such software projects are leading the industry in language support. <ept i="1">&lt;/f1&gt;</ept>Although this book is about FOSS, it will also be useful to learn about software localisation in general, and about contributing to FOSS projects in more ways than just localisation.</seg>

        <seg>While several topics are discussed in this book, the scope is obviously limited to keep it at a manageable size. Many more topics might be relevant to localisation in a specific language, or with certain tools. We limit the discussion to topics of general interest to most FOSS localisation, and we limit the discussion on tools mostly to Virtaal and Pootle.</seg>

        <seg>Making software available in a new language allows a whole new group of people to use software who might not have been able to do so before. Localised software might be a crucial requirement for someone to be able to take part in the digital world. As we spend more time with computers, and more people do their jobs with computers, the need increases for everyone to be able to use <ph x="0">&lt;t0/&gt;</ph>computers, even if they only know one language well. By localising software, you can empower users to be first-class citizens of the digital world, without being slowed down by a language barrier or needing to feel as if their language is unimportant. Using your language in the realm of information technology is part of keeping it alive and relevant to the things that people do.</seg>

        <seg>Any professional translator will tell you that translation isn’t just some mechanical process. It is a creative process, a topic of academic research, and students can study translation at many institutions. When we see how software struggles to translate from one language to another, we see that a translation requires attention to detail to really feel right. The principles of document translation apply to software localisation as well, and you will definitely benefit from any knowledge of translation. Don’t think that any computer programmer can translate software well just because they understand computers.</seg>

        <seg>However, there are several areas in which software translation is different from other types of translation. Although the text is often of a more technical nature, that is not the only issue. Different <ph x="0">&lt;t0/&gt;</ph>tools are used, and there are different constraints on what you can do in a translation. Furthermore we devote a whole chapter in this book to some of the technical issues that appear in software localisation (see page <bpt i="1" x="1">&lt;bf1&gt;</bpt>27<ept i="1">&lt;/bf1&gt;</ept>).

        <seg>An interesting thing to keep in mind is that a translated document is usually read in a predictable way, from top to bottom, and seen in the same way it left the hands of the translator. With software, it is impossible to know exactly what a user will see, and in which order. Some of the text is changed when the software is running. A user might use software differently from you and therefore experience your translation in a different way than you do when using the translated software!</seg>

Furthermore you should aim to harmonise your terminology and style with other applications on the same platform that the application will run on (Windows, KDE, GNOME, OS X, etc.).

Especially if you are doing localisation that is entirely new for your language, take into consideration that users sometimes need a bit of time to get used to new terms in a localised user interface.

It is used by several FOSS projects to manage their localisation work. Pootle allows online translation, and it has several features to help with review and team organisation. It is ideal for team work, casual contributions, and translation sprints (Translate@thons). Visit the official Pootle server to see what it is all about:</seg>

        <seg>You don’t need to choose between these two tools – they complement each other. Even if a project is hosted on Pootle, you can still translate it offline in Virtaal and upload your files later. These tools are described in more detail in the section on “<bpt i="0" x="0">&lt;bf0&gt;</bpt>Localisation tools<ept i="0">&lt;/bf0&gt;</ept>” on page <bpt i="1" x="1">&lt;bf1&gt;</bpt>38<ept i="1">&lt;/bf1&gt;</ept>. Several sections will refer to specific features of the tools, so it would be good if you can ensure that you have Virtaal installed, and maybe have an account on a Pootle server for you to follow the discussion in the book. Virtaal will provide the most help during your translation with colour highlighting of important things, and integration with helpful resources if you have an internet connection.</seg>

        <seg>Before you can do any work, you need to know that you can view your language on screen. For many languages this is not a problem any more, but you need to know that you have the necessary fonts installed on your computer. Maybe there is a version of Wikipedia with your language, or a local online newspaper, and you can verify that you can view all the characters correctly. If you are having any problems, these sites might provide some links to fonts and instructions to be able to view your language on screen. It is important to know that you must work with so-called Unicode fonts. You can consult the Unicode font guide: <bpt i="0" x="0">&lt;a0&gt;</bpt>http://www.unifont.org/fontguide/<ept i="0">&lt;/a0&gt;</ept></seg>

        <seg>Since you might be spending most of your time in a translation program, you might want to paste some text in the translation to check that you can view the text there as well, and not just in your web browser.

You might want to ensure that there are good <ph x="0">&lt;t0/&gt;</ph>instructions available for users, customised for their operating system if they need to install an extra font. Keep in mind that users without fonts won’t be able to read a website written in your language without that font, unless you publish instructions in a PDF document with the fonts embedded. (This way the users don’t need the font on their computers.) Some emerging web technologies allow a website to supply a font, but you should probably not count on that.</seg>

        <seg>Whenever you contribute the first translation or support for your language to an application, you will need to identify your language accurately to the software developers. When referring to your language, remember to use the English name of your language, and keep in mind that the developers might not know about about your country and relevant dialects. Identifying the language properly is usually done by means of a two or three letter code for your language. For example, the two letter code for English is ‘en’, and the two letter code for Russian is ‘ru’. It is common in FOSS projects to use two letter codes whenever they are available, and to use three letter language codes when no two letter code exists. These codes come from a standard called ISO 639. More information is available on Wikipedia:</seg>

        <seg>If your language is spoken in multiple countries, it might be customary to do separate localisations for the different variants of the language in the respective countries. In such a case, the code is augmented with a country code, such as ‘fr_CA’ for French in Canada, or en_GB for English in Great Britain. Note that the country is usually only specified if there is a need to do separate localisation for each country where the language is spoken. Only specify a country if needed by the software project, or if you know that your localisation is part of a set of different localisations for your language.</seg>

        <seg>A common mistake when starting with localisation, is to ignore the capitalisation in the source text, and always or never using capital letters. If your language should use capital letters, this can create a bad impression and affect readability of the text. If your language doesn’t use capital letters, this mostly doesn’t affect you. However, capitalisation can possibly give a hint about the meaning or use of a message in front of you. Capitalisation could indicate proper names (like brands or product names) and a complete lack of capitalisation might indicate that the translation is part of a bigger sentence.</seg>

When something is written in Title Case, most words start with a capital letter. This is not very common in other languages (German and languages with similar orthographies being notable exceptions). Ensure that you follow your language's rules and customs with regards to capitalisation. In most cases, we will write brand names and product names unchanged.</seg>

        <seg>Another area where guidelines for your team might help, is to ensure that attention is paid to punctuation and spacing. If the use of punctuation and spacing is similar to English in your language, it might still be useful to specify that translators should pay attention to whether a message ends with a colon (:), question mark (?), exclamation mark (!) or an ellipse (…). Also keep in mind that an ellipse can be represented with three separate dots, or a special ellipse character which might be hard to type. Virtaal makes it easy to insert the special ellipse character by highlighting it as a placeable in the source text (see page <bpt i="0" x="0">&lt;bf0&gt;</bpt>39<ept i="0">&lt;/bf0&gt;</ept> for working with placeables).</seg>

This is often a programming mistake which you should report, but you will still encounter this. The use of two spaces between sentences is usually not very important to follow, although it might help to ensure consistency.

Good terminology can ensure that the translated version of the program isn’t misleading the users, or giving the wrong impression.

The same feature is also available in Pootle (see page <bpt i="2" x="2">&lt;bf2&gt;</bpt>41<ept i="2">&lt;/bf2&gt;</ept>). Such software analyses the text for frequently occurring terms and produces a list for you to translate. Some of the suggested terms might not be important or meaningful to work on, but see the list of terms as a suggestion to save you time.</seg>

        <seg>One disadvantage of a terminology extraction program, is that it probably has no knowledge of which terms are most used in the very visible parts of the software. For example, you might get some terms used very frequently in error messages. Of course these are very useful to standardise if you will be translating the error messages, and has all the advantages it offers to the team in terms of productivity and motivation.

        <seg>It is common to find things in translations that should be left untranslated. Easy examples include things like <bpt i="0" x="0">&lt;f0&gt;</bpt>e-mail addresses<ept i="0">&lt;/f0&gt;</ept> and <bpt i="1" x="1">&lt;f1&gt;</bpt>website addresses<ept i="1">&lt;/f1&gt;</ept> (URLs) that should be left unchanged. Ensure that everyone on your team knows what e-mail addresses and URLs look like. There are exceptions: example addresses such as <bpt i="2" x="2">&lt;a2&gt;</bpt>http://example.com<ept i="2">&lt;/a2&gt;</ept> or <bpt i="3" x="3">&lt;a3&gt;</bpt>user@business.com<ept i="3">&lt;/a3&gt;</ept> might simply be intended to show the user what type of input they should provide to the software. If you are sure that these are only examples, it might make them more accessible if they are translated, since a user might realise that it is only an example. In the case where a URL points to a website or documentation that is available in different languages, you might want to change the address to point to the version in your language (if it is available).</seg>

        <seg>There is a convention to write the argument in capital letters, which should help you to recognise it. Having the argument (such as “PLAYLIST”) translated should help the user to realise that the option (such as “--add-to”) should be used unchanged, and that the argument (the translated placeholder) should be changed to the relevant value. When other help text refers the argument, it is also customary to use it capitalised in a similar way.

        <seg>Escaping is a way to represent special text. An escaped sequence consists of an escape marker followed by one or more reserved characters. Translators don’t need to work with this frequently, but it is good to be aware of them. The most common is the backslash (\) followed by a single letter. In most cases you will see from the original source text when these should be used, and in many cases you can follow the example of the source text closely.</seg>

If the variable has a name (like “number” in some of the examples above) you will usually know exactly what will be filled in.

In some of the examples above, the percentage sign (%) is used at the start of a variable. This is part of the variable and disappears when the program is running. If you really want a percentage sign to show, you have to use the special placeholder “%%” which will display as a single percentage sign in the translated program.

        <seg>If your language does not have plurals, you will simply translate the two English strings with one string. This is common for some languages in Asia. If your language uses singular and plural nouns like English, you will make a translation of the two strings by also entering two strings – one with the singular and one with the plural. If your language uses more than two noun forms, a separate string for each noun form should be entered to allow a correct message to be displayed to the user depending on the number of things mentioned.</seg>

        <seg>Each software project has its own schedule and pace of development. If a project releases new versions very often and accepts translations at any time, you can probably contribute your translation whenever it suits you. For projects that only release on certain occasions, you want to ensure that your work will be useful to as many people as possible, so you should try to think strategically about your participation in the project.</seg>

        <seg>It is common for projects to announce their release plans in advance and ask translators to update their translations. This is an excellent time to contribute your translation, as it is probably an indication that the developer is actually thinking about translators, and is trying to create good circumstances for them to do their work in. If you are starting with a new translation of a project, you should take extra care to ensure you have enough time to complete the whole task and do the testing.

This means that the text that needs to be translated is finalised for the release, and no further changes are planned for the text. This means that you can do your translation work knowing that you are <ph x="1">&lt;t1/&gt;</ph>translating the final text and probably won’t need to adapt your translations to changes in the original text until the release happens. Such an announcement might also specify which software version will be released, and maybe which branch in the version control system should be used.

Some contributors work for companies who contribute to FOSS projects for several reasons. The important thing to realise is that many of the people you encounter in a FOSS project, might be involved there for different reasons than you are. If you want to get help from someone, it might demand some of their time, and they might not be able to help you right away because they are at work. Someone might not be interested to help you because they are not interested in the specific issue you need help with. Usually people are quite helpful, but it is useful to keep in mind that very few people have an obligation to help you. Therefore always be polite, especially when asking for help. Also try to help other people in the project when you can. There is a big culture of doing favours in FOSS projects, so remember that they are favours, and try to do the same to others.</seg>

        <seg>A very important step in your localisation process is to review the translations in the running application. This will allow you to see the result of your translation work, and is always exciting to see for the first time. The basic principles of testing is the same, regardless of how the translated application is executed or built. The ways of how to do this can be very different for different programs, therefore we’ll discuss only the most common case in the next section.</seg>

        <seg>The purpose of in-product review is to review the translation in the way that the user will experience it. Now it is not just about the language issues, but about the whole experience of the user. To ensure that you test the translation well, you have to try to find every part of the program. Go systematically through every menu, look at every option in every dialogue box. Look for tooltips when you keep the mouse over some part of the program. You can even try to do unusual things, like opening unsupported files or entering invalid values in the configuration to try to see error messages. Even the error messages should be translated and reviewed!</seg>

        <seg>Important issues to check for include things like consistent style and terminology, whether references to buttons use the same text as the buttons themselves, and if translations make sense in the context where they are used on the screen.

        <seg>Another important thing to check for is any strange layout caused by very long or very short translations. It could be that the programmer didn’t anticipate a translation as long or as short as yours, and the user interface might not appear neatly any more. Most software in the FOSS world will try to adapt automatically to changes in the translation by resizing things as necessary. In a few remaining projects it is still necessary to resize these things yourself. This is a time consuming task that requires you to spend much more time on testing, and might also require that you test the software on multiple platforms.</seg>

        <seg>Another important thing to test in the running application is the use of access keys. We discussed access keys earlier on page <bpt i="0" x="0">&lt;bf0&gt;</bpt>34<ept i="0">&lt;/bf0&gt;</ept>. Now you need to check that the access keys were chosen well, and make any necessary corrections. In each menu, and each dialogue box, it is important to test every access key. It is usually activated by pressing Alt and the underlined letter. It might be necessary to press Alt to see the characters underlined. Does the relevant letter activate the control correctly? What happens when you press the letter again? If two controls on the screen use the same letter as access key, it often happens that they are alternately activated when you press that key. This is not a big problem, but should be corrected in your translation if possible. In big menus and dialogue boxes, you might need to plan carefully to select unique access keys for each control. However, remember that the most important functions, especially in the main application window is probably <ph x="1">&lt;t1/&gt;</ph>the most important for you to review, and to ensure that they work well. Also try to keep the access keys consistent for common things (like “File” and “Help”) between applications.</seg>

        <seg>As much as we might want to have all software in our own language, we will always have too little time, too few people to help us, and the amount of software will just get more and more. Does that mean we should give up? Of course not. It has been shown many times in the FOSS world that a small team or even an individual person can do a lot of good localisation work and have a lot of translated software available. This section explores some ideas of how to maximise your impact, and tries to provide an idea of what to do if you can’t do everything. Remember to keep your goals in mind!</seg>

Remember that your audience will develop with you – you can expect people to gradually become more used to localised software if they didn’t use it before. If you are starting with new localisation, skipping things like the technical error messages in the internals of the software just makes sense, and provides you with an opportunity to work on things that more users will see.

In some cases it might be necessary to convert the unit of measurement. You will find some websites or software that can help you do a conversion from miles to kilometres, for example. However, when a physical quantity is only used as an example (usually with a nice round number), consider simply leaving it at a round number and changing the unit. For example, when a game talks about some gold weighing 100 pounds, changing it to 100 kg might make it easier to read without impacting the message. Make sure that it is 100% safe to do this. If you are unsure, translate it more literally or convert the unit.</seg>

        <seg>GTK+ is an underlying platform used for building a lot of software, but maybe best known for its use in the GNOME project. GTK+ provides software with several things that are common in software: dialogue boxes to open and save files, print options, and most importantly for this part of the book, some commonly used strings for common things like “OK”, “Cancel”, “Preferences”, “Copy”, “Paste”, etc. Since many programs use these strings from GTK+, it is useful to look at translating the strings from the GTK+ project for the benefit of all these programs. Although the translation file for GKT+ is a bit big, it is mostly quite easy to identify the most interesting strings in the file from sight, or by looking for the strings marked as “stock items”.</seg>
