        <target state="translated">من المهم الوعي بأهمية توطين البرمجيات، فحتى وإن استطعنا استخدام التقنية بلغة أجنبية فإن التعرض المستمر للغات الأجنبية يُضعف تدريجيا من ملكة اللغة الأم. في اعتقادي أن اللغات التي لا تُستخدم في كل نواحي الحياة تواجه خطر الانقراض في عصر العولمة الطاغية. لذا فتوطين البرمجيات لا يساعد فقط على إتاحة التقنية للعموم، بل ويساعد أيضا على إحياء اللغات والمحافظة على ثقافاتها.</target>
