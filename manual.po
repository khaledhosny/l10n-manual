"Computers are amazing tools. They can help us in so many ways, yet we are "

"تعتبر الحواسيب أدوات رائعة إذ يمكن استخدامها بطرق لا حصر لها، لكن كثيرا ما "
"يزعجنا ألا نستطيع استخدامها على الوجه الذي نريده. نتفاعل باستمرار مع التقنية "

"A lot of technologies we work with often, such as software, web sites and "

"the onslaught of globalisation. Software localisation can therefore not only "
"help with access to information and useful technology, but also with "
"language revival and cultural preservation."

"من المهم الوعي بأهمية توطين البرمجيات، فحتى وإن استطعنا استخدام التقنية بلغة "

"في عصر العولمة الطاغية. لذا فتوطين البرمجيات لا يساعد فقط على إتاحة التقنية "

msgid ""
"If the name is a word explaining what it does, simply translate the name."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the name is obscure or very technical in nature, you can consider using "
"it without transliteration if it doesn’t occur very often."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the name has no obvious meaning, transliterate the pronunciation of the "
"name. If this is too long for an acronym (such as HTML), you might want to "
"transcribe each letter with an equivalent letter in your script, possibly "
"separating them with dots or spaces if it might be confused with a word."

msgid ""
"A good dictionary can be very useful for your work. However, it can be "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a translation tool provides terminology assistance, it can be a great "
"help, since the translators can check the prescribed terminology more often, "
"and might be confronted with it even when they didn’t consider checking. It "
"should also make it easy to insert a term without typing, which can save "
"time and avoid typing errors."

msgid "Reuse"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"During translation, a translator creates valuable information – terminology "

msgid ""
"Here you can see how similar translations can be shown to a translator "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Storing and reusing previous translations is called <f0>translation "
"memory</f0><f1>. This is different from terminology in that complete "
"translations or sentences are handled, and software might provide a "
"suggestion even if it isn’t quite the same as what you are translating. So "
"while whole words might be wrong in the suggestion, it provides a way to "
"save a lot of typing, and ensures a consistent sentence structure between "
"similar translations.</f1>"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Any existing translations of sufficient quality should normally be "
"considered for reuse. You might want to give preference to related "
"translations, such as those for the desktop environment you are translating "
"for. For example, you might prefer GNOME translations when translating a "
"GNOME application, rather than KDE translations. In reality the style of "
"translations between different desktop environments won’t differ "
"substantially for most languages, and you will probably benefit from using "
"all available translations in your translation memory."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Short messages are more likely to be ambiguous. Translations consisting of "
"single terms such as “view” and “alert” probably have different translations "
"depending on context. Even longer entries like “Empty trash” is ambiguous "
"(it could describe the state of the trash, or be a command to make the trash "
"empty). Blindly reusing old translations in cases like these are obviously "
"dangerous. All reuse of existing translations should be reviewed to ensure "
"that they are suitable for the current application in terms of style and "
"terminology. Reviewing the suggestions might also provide an "
"<t0/>opportunity to find errors that might exist in previous translations. "
"Use the opportunity to fix the original source of the error if a suggestion "

"<f0>Machine translation</f0> refers to translation suggestions automatically "

"provide very useful results in certain cases, although results vary a lot "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By contrast, suggestions from a translation memory is the result of software "
"suggesting previous work done by human translators. It might be a "
"translation of a different piece of text, and translation software should "
"indicate the difference between your current source text and the source text "
"of the suggestion. Virtaal highlights these differences to help make a "
"judgement of how relevant a suggestion is and where it should be edited."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Whereas a translation memory will not always have relevant suggestions, "
"machine translation software might always be able to provide some "
"suggestion, even if it is not very good. In some cases it might require less "

"correct any possible errors."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For the purposes of this book, automated testing refers to using software to "
"automatically review our translations. Since software is really good at "
"simple repetitive tasks, it is ideal to help us discover things like "
"spelling mistakes, errors in capitalisation, unwanted spaces, as well as "
"mistakes with variables and markup. Several of the issues we discussed in "
"“<bf0>Technical issues</bf0>” on page <bf1>28</bf1> might be detected by "
"automated review tools."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Pootle and Virtaal incorporates several quality checks that will help you to "
"find certain types of errors. Some of these are only of a cosmetic nature "
"(such as spaces and punctuation). Others are a bit more serious (such as a "
"missing web address or suspiciously short translation). Some tests might "
"indicate serious issues that could crash the software or prevent some "
"functionality from working (such as errors with variables)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Read more about all these quality checks here:"
msgstr ""

msgid "http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/toolkit/pofilter_tests"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is important to realise that these tests could suggest that some "
"translations contain mistakes when they are indeed valid. Don’t follow the "
"advice of these tests blindly, and don’t let their results encourage you to "
"do something incorrect or unusual for your language. The tests are just "
"tools intended to help you. We have found them of crucial importance in our "
"work, especially with inexperienced translators, although even the most "
"experienced translators sometimes make mistakes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Automated testing is cheap in the sense that it doesn’t require much of your "
"time. It quickly shows you where to spend your time to fix a possible "
"problem. Always review the quality checks – it is an easy way to avoid "
"certain errors."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Software written using the Gettext translation system usually use a program "
"called <f0>msgfmt</f0><f1> to convert the translation file into the file "
"needed by the software. It also does some basic checks, such as checking the "
"file format, invalid use of variables, etc. Any serious error reported by "
"this tool </f1><f2>must</f2><f3> be fixed. Usually the translation will not "
"be used if there are any errors reported by msgfmt. Software written using "
"the Qt translation system, has a similar program called "
"</f3><f4>lrelease</f4><f5>.</f5>"
msgstr ""

msgid "Manual review"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Although automated review tools can help us a lot, there will always be room "
"for review by another human translator. If you join an existing team, the "
"existing team coordinator might review all submissions from other team "
"members. You might be able to ask someone to read over your translation file "
"and check for possible areas of improvement. Another pair of eyes can often "
"help to improve the quality. A translation program with spell checker and "
"quality checks is probably the <t0/>best software to use for this task."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Mature translation teams usually have an arrangement of how work will flow "
"between translators and reviewers, and might even have rules that all files "
"have to be checked by a reviewer. In some projects there are tools available "
"to help you implement such workflows, and to help in communication in the "
"team. The localisation website of the GNOME project is a great example in "
"this regard."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you are working with PO files, it might be easy enough to simply mark "
"translations as fuzzy when you still want someone to review them. The "
"reviewer can then approve the translation by removing the fuzzy marker. "
"Although this might be a bit limiting in some cases, it is a simple way to "
"incorporate manual review into your localisation process."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"During review, reviewers should pay attention to spelling, grammar, "
"terminology, consistency, and all the other things that might be important. "
"When you review someone else’s work, always try to provide polite feedback "
"to serve as encouragement."
msgstr ""

msgid "In-product review"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A very important step in your localisation process is to review the "
"translations in the running application. This will allow you to see the "
"result of your translation work, and is always exciting to see for the first "
"time. The basic principles of testing is the same, regardless of how the "
"translated application is executed or built. The ways of how to do this can "
"be very different for different programs, therefore we’ll discuss only the "
"most common case in the next section."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The purpose of in-product review is to review the translation in the way "
"that the user will experience it. Now it is not just about the language "
"issues, but about the whole experience of the user. To ensure that you test "
"the translation well, you have to try to find every part of the program. Go "
"systematically through every menu, look at every option in every dialogue "
"box. Look for tooltips when you keep the mouse over some part of the "
"program. You can even try to do unusual things, like opening unsupported "
"files or entering invalid values in the configuration to try to see error "
"messages. Even the error messages should be translated and reviewed!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Important issues to check for include things like consistent style and "
"terminology, whether references to buttons use the same text as the buttons "
"themselves, and if translations make sense in the context where they are "
"used on the screen. Remember that programs might sometimes combine "
"translations from several files, so consistency isn’t just about the "
"translation quality in a single file."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Another important thing to check for is any strange layout caused by very "
"long or very short translations. It could be that the programmer didn’t "
"anticipate a translation as long or as short as yours, and the user "
"interface might not appear neatly any more. Most software in the FOSS world "
"will try to adapt automatically to changes in the translation by resizing "
"things as necessary. In a few remaining projects it is still necessary to "
"resize these things yourself. This is a time consuming task that requires "
"you to spend much more time on testing, and might also require that you test "
"the software on multiple platforms."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Another important thing to test in the running application is the use of "
"accelerators. We discussed accelerators earlier on page <bf0>35</bf0>. Now "
"you need to check that the accelerators were chosen well, and make any "
"necessary corrections. In each menu, and each dialogue box, it is important "
"to test every accelerator. It is usually activated by pressing Alt and the "
"underlined letter. It might be necessary to press Alt to see the characters "
"underlined. Does the relevant letter activate the control correctly? What "
"happens when you press the letter again? If two controls on the screen use "
"the same letter as accelerator, it often happens that they are alternately "
"activated when you press that key. This is not a big problem, but should be "
"corrected in your translation if possible. In big menus and dialogue boxes, "
"you might need to plan carefully to select unique accelerators for each "
"control. However, remember that the most important functions, especially in "
"the main application window is probably <t1/>the most important for you to "
"review, and to ensure that they work well. Also try to keep the accelerators "
"consistent for common things (like “File” and “Help”) between applications."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you translated documentation, you should review it in the help viewer. "
"Check that page titles and links between pages are correct, and that any "
"search features show the correctly translated entries. Ensure that the help "
"text uses the same terminology as the application. Reviewing the translated "
"content itself is similar to reviewing translated documents."
msgstr ""

msgid "Testing a program using Gettext"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Many FOSS projects make use of software called Gettext to support many "
"languages in their project. In such projects you would have translated a PO "
"file, and need to generate an MO file for testing. Some translation programs "
"might be able to do this easily. Otherwise you can use the program "
"<f0>msgfmt</f0><f1> from the command-line like this:</f1>"
msgstr ""

msgid "msgfmt <s0/>-cv <s1/>current_translation.po <s2/>-o program_name.mo"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<f0>This will perform some basic tests on your translation file (refer to "
"page </f0><f1><bf2>50</bf2></f1><f3>) and mention any serious issues that "
"still need to be fixed. If nothing serious was detected, it will generate "
"the file “program_name.mo”. The correct name will depend on the application "
"(look for the current .mo file in your or other languages), but is usually "
"just the name of the application in lower letters, followed by “.mo”.</f3>"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now copy the new .mo file you created over the existing file (after making a "
"backup), or copy it in the correct location. Here are the most common "
"directories that are used (replace ‘xx’ with your language code ):"

"As much as we might want to have all software in our own language, we will "

"course not. It has been shown many times in the FOSS world that a small team "
"or even an individual person can do a lot of good localisation work and "
"have a lot of translated software available. This section explores some "
"ideas of how to maximise your impact, and tries to provide an idea of what "

msgid ""
"If there is too much work to do, or you think there is too much work to do, "
"it is very useful to know <f0>exactly how much work is involved in "
"translating a certain file or piece of software. It is common in many FOSS "
"projects to count the number of strings (messages), but in reality this "

msgid ""
"While we would usually want to translate everything in a given piece of "

"Remember that your audience will develop with you – the more people use "
